The directory "PA2_code" contains the entirety of the codebase, with my models and layers (decoding/encoding, blocks, feedForward, Attention) all implemented in transformer.py
and everything else implemented in main.py. The rest of the files remain unchanged from their starter code. My code is pretty simple to run: simply enter the CSE156_PA2_SP24 directory, go to the
terminal and type in python3 PA2_code/main.py parti where the i can be replaced by 1, 2, or 3 respectively to run those parts of the projects. To try my part 3 performance improvement code, simply
navigate to the part3 section of my main method in main.py and read the short instructions to change the hyperparameters and run the code.
The directory "speechesdataset" contains the data to be used for this assignment.
